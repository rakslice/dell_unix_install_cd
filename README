Scripts to create a Dell Unix installation CD.

This scripts setup is for use on a Linux system with `genisoimage`, `xxd`, etc.

The resulting CD will work on a system with an Dell Unix compatible SCSI controller
(i.e. AHA-154x) with a CD drive attached to it.

If the SCSI BIOS knows how to boot an El Torito bootable CD (w/ floppy emulation),
it can boot from the CD all on its own; otherwise you can provide the CD's
`boot.cdramd_128.img` floppy along with the CD to get the kernel running and its
driver will take care of the rest.

Instructions:

1. Put the `boot.img` and `system.img` floppy disk images into `original_images`
2. Put the base system cpio archive, as a file called `base`, into `original_images`
3. If you have anything else you want on the CD for convenience (e.g. other packages),
   put make a directory called `additional_contents` in the checkout directory and
   put them in.
4. Run `./make_iso.bash`
5. The resulting ISO will be `dell_unix.iso` in the checkout directory.
